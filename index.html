		<h2>Summer 2014</h2>
		<p>Advised by <a href = "http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vbz/">Victor Zordan</a> at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Graphics Lab, 
		I worked with two others to design and implement a memory game meant to assist seniors and children with ADHD. In collaboration with 
		UCR's psychology department, we incorporated n-back training, working memory, categorization, and multiple object tracking tasks into 
		the game's design. I implemented the working memory task, pattern matching, and also created the initial artwork. Currently, other members 
		of the UCR Graphics Lab are continuing working on the game.</p>

		<h1>Defiant Planet</h1>
		<h2>Spring 2014</h2>
		<p>Defiant Planet is a 3D real-time strategy (RTS) game created by a team of four programmers including myself and two artists. 
		As the commander of an empire, you must build an army in order to fight and defend against a rival empire.
		However, in order to do so, you must venture throughout the map and harvest the necessary resources. But beware of 
		angering Mother Nature! Over-harvesting and over-building in any one region of the map will cause Mother Nature to fight back 
		with environmental disasters.</p>

		<h1>Escape Clockworktopia</h1>
		<h2>Fall 2013</h2>
		<p>Escape Clockworktopia is a game created in collaboration with two others during a 24-hours-long Google Game Jam challenge. 
		In this sidescroller game, you play as a tank navigating through a destroyed steampunk-like world, Clockworktopia, and 
		you must shoot the falling gears which broke off the collapsing city in order to survive.</p>

		<h1>The Good Human and the Evil Koopa</h1>
		<h2>Spring 2013</h2>
		<p>"The Good Human and the Evil Koopa" is an award-winning essay that analyzes character trends in video games.
		The essay won the James E. Rice Award from the John S. Knight Institute and was published in their Discoveries journal.</P>
		
		<p>The abstract is as follows:</p>
		
		<p id = "abstract">Like movies, books, and other forms of entertainment, video games tailor their design to the age of the desired audience. 
		This study focuses on the design of friendly and aggressive game characters as a function of the target player's age. 
		Since children are sensitive to salient physical features and are likely to imitate aggressive human models, "E"-rated games 
		tend to contain human-like allies and animal-like enemies. This difference in the design of friends and does results in 
		greater physical differences between - and consequently easier identification of - friendly and aggressive characters. The 
		choice of animal-like enemies may arguably prevent young players from committing acts of aggression against human or 
		human-like characters. In contrast, since older players can identify less obvious enemies and understand the justification 
		for killing human characters, "M"-rated games tend to contain more human-like enemies. </p>
